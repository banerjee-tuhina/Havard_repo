After a slow start, Zverev raised his game and showed more poise in the crucial moments against the 27th seed to become the first German to reach the last four at the US Open since Boris Becker in 1995. ""I just started playing maybe a little bit more aggressive because if I would`ve played the way I played (at the start), it`s not the level for a quarter-final match at a Grand Slam,"" said Zverev. Coric made a flying start to his first career Grand Slam quarter-final match and needed only 24 minutes to wrap up the first set during which he took advantage of 12 unforced errors from a flat Zverev. But the German showed plenty of fight in the second set as he came back from a break down and overcame four double-faults and 15 unforced errors to level the match by winning the tiebreak before unleashing an extended roar. ""I had to start playing better and I was a little bit more consistent then as well. My serve got better and I thought to myself `I`m down 6-1 4-2, I have nothing to lose at the moment"" said Zverev. The fired-up German was put to the test again in a pressure-packed third set where, after trading early breaks with Coric, he twice had to serve to stay in the set before going on to cruise through another tiebreak. Trailing 5-6 15-30 in the third, Zverev came up with a potentially match-saving point when he raced to the net from deep in the court to slice a shot past his opponent. ""Obviously a huge point. But this is what I`ve been doing for the past six months, I`ve been in the gym, I`ve been on the track trying to get my speed up,"" said Zverev. ""This is the moment where it pays off."" He opened the fourth set in emphatic fashion, sending a volley past Coric to take the opening game to love. Zverev then saved four break points in the fifth game for a 3-2 lead and broke for a 5-3 cushion that sent him on his way to victory.  "

http://zeenews.india.com/people/thank-you-katrina-for-always-being-there-for-me-ali-abbas-zafar-2308615.html,Thank you Katrina for always being there for me: Ali Abbas Zafar,09-09-2020," New Delhi: Filmmaker Ali Abbas Zafar is credited with Rs 300 crore blockbusters such as 'Sultan', 'Tiger Zinda Hai', and more recently 'Bharat' which also did phenomenal business at the Box Office. Hailing from Dehradun, Ali began his journey in Yash Raj Films (YRF) as an assistant director and finally graduated into becoming a star filmmaker. Recounting his inspirational journey so far, Ali Abbas Zafar said: My journey from being an assistant director to director has been very exciting and I must say, little filmy. I was an assistant director in YRF on Jhoom Barabar Jhoom, Badmaash Company, New York, Tashan and then while I was assisting, I was writing films parallelly. So, after I finished 'Badmaash Company', I gave a script to Adi.   He added, ""One day, I was driving to Goa with some friends and he called me and said I read your script and I think it's pretty good. It just needs some minor fixing and we are good to go. I would say it's been miraculous, it's been fascinating and to be a complete outsider in this industry, to get a chance to direct for YRF and to work with Katrina, Imran and Adi has been a blessing."" In the process of directing Mere Brother Ki Dulhan, Ali made a friend for a lifetime in Katrina Kaif. He says, “Katrina and me are like chalk and cheese! Definitely best of friends but we have our disagreements too. That is what keeps our relationship real and relevant. You just need to be true to yourself and especially when you find close friends, you need to be honest to them. I've always tried to do the best I could do with her and she supported me in every possible way she could.”  “When she said yes to Mere Brother Ki Dulhan, the role on paper was very strong but you know I was a complete newcomer and she was riding super high on her success. For her to be generous enough, to choose me over other filmmakers who were offering her scripts at that point of time, was a very brave decision. Since then, till now we've been more of personal friends than professional friends. So yes, thank you, Katrina, for always being there for me and it's been great to have you in my life!"", he said.  Ali revealed, “I personally feel working with YRF from Mere Brother Ki Dulhan to Tiger Zinda Hai, I think as a director there was complete creative freedom. I think I found my voice as a film-maker in YRF. It's a dream to have a producer like Adi Chopra because he himself is a director and he understands that if he is giving responsibility to someone to direct a film, to tell a story, he just needs to fly, he needs to have wings of his own creativity.”    "
http://zeenews.india.com/health/body-temperature-plays-critical-role-in-realising-diet-induced-health-benefits-study-2308614,Body temperature plays critical role in realising diet-induced health benefits: Study ,09-09-2020," Washington: Cutting calories significantly may not be an easy task for many, but it is tied to a host of health benefits ranging from longer lifespan to a much lower chance of developing cancer, heart disease, diabetes, and neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer`s. A new study from teams led by Scripps Research Professors Bruno Conti, PhD, and Gary Siuzdak, PhD, highlights the critical role that body temperature plays in realising these diet-induced health benefits.  Through their findings, the scientists pave the way toward creating a medicinal compound that imitates the valuable effects of reduced body temperature. The research appears in Science Signaling. Conti has spent years studying how and why calorie restriction leads to better health, with the ultimate goal of translating the findings into medicines that can mimic what happens naturally when a person eats less. One consistent observation is that when mammals consume less food, their body temperature drops. It`s evolution`s way of helping us conserve energy until the food is available again, Conti explains. It makes sense, considering that up to half of what we eat every day is turned into energy simply to maintain our core body temperature. Conti`s previous work showed that temperature reduction can increase lifespan independently of calorie restriction--and that these effects involve activation of certain cellular processes, most of which remain to be identified. On the flip side, studies have shown that preventing body temperature from dropping can actually counteract the positive effects of calorie restriction.  Notably, in an experiment involving calorie-restricted mice, anti-cancer benefits were diminished when core body temperature remained the same.""It`s not easy to discern what`s driving the beneficial changes of calorie restriction,"" Conti says.  ""Is it the reduced calories on their own, or the change in body temperature that typically happens when one consumes fewer calories"" Or is it a combination of both"" *Metabolites hold the answer. In the new research, Conti and his team designed an experiment that would allow them to independently evaluate the effects of reduced nutrients and those of body temperature. They compared one group of calorie-restricted mice housed at room temperature--about 68 degrees Fahrenheit (22 degrees Celsius) to another group housed at 86 degrees (30 degrees Celsius). The warmer environment invoked ""thermoneutrality,"" a state at which most animals cannot easily reduce their body temperature. The Siuzdak team, using a technology they developed called activity metabolomics, then evaluated the mice by measuring their metabolites, or chemicals released by the animals` metabolism. Through this, they were able to look for molecules in the bloodstream and in the brain that are changed by the reduction of either nutrients or body temperature. ""The data we collected showed that temperature has an equal or greater effect than nutrients on metabolism during calorie restriction,"" Conti says. Notably, the team provided the first comprehensive profiling of the metabolites that are changed by temperature reduction. Through a computing analysis of results from both groups of mice, the scientists were able to prioritize which metabolites were most responsible for triggering changes to core body temperature. In a separate experiment, they also showed it is possible to administer certain metabolites as a drug to affect body temperature. Conti says further work to validate the changes induced by temperature during calorie restriction should provide novel targets for future medicines he calls ""temperature mimetics,"" which could offer the health-promoting effects without having to reduce body temperature.

http://zeenews.india.com/cricket/indian-premier-league-2020-shane-warne-wants-sourav-ganguly-to-try-5-overs-per-bowler-rule-2308611.html,Indian Premier League 2020: Shane Warne wants Sourav Ganguly to try '5 overs per bowler' rule,09-09-2020," Dubai: Shane Warne, the legendary former Australian spinner, wants Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) chief Sourav Ganguly to try 5-overs per bowler in the upcoming IPL 2020 season. Currently, a bowler can deliver a maximum of 4 overs in T20 cricket, but, Warne is of the opinion that this rule should be changed to a maximum of 5-overs per bowler for T20 cricket. The 50-year old shared the idea through his official Twitter account by writing: ""Getting a lot of great reply’s to my suggestion re a maximum of 5 overs per bowler in T/20 cricket ! Let’s make it happen ASAP @ICC! Maybe we could try it in the @IPL starting on Sept19@SGanguly99."" Getting a lot of great reply’s to my suggestion re a maximum of 5 overs per bowler in T/20 cricket ! Let’s make it happen ASAP @ICC ! Maybe we could try it in the @IPL starting on Sept 19 @SGanguly99  — Shane Warne (@ShaneWarne) September 8, 2020 Warne’s seriousness regarding the idea can be seen from the fact that he has not just tagged BCCI chief Sourav Ganguly but also the International Cricket Council ( ICC) handle. It remains to be seen whether this idea is taken up by the stakeholders and implemented in the near future. Warner’s idea is sure to ignite a debate in the cricketing circles especially at a time when limited-overs cricket has increasingly become in the favor of the batsmen with shorter boundaries, powerplays and two new balls- all assisting them. If the Australian legend’s idea is implemented, it is going to help the bowling side as they can then give an extra over to their best bowlers which will make it difficult for the batsmen to churn-out those extra runs. Warne is widely considered to be the greatest spinner of all time and picked up 708 wickets for Australia in 145 Test matches. The spinner also has significant experience in the IPL where he led Rajasthan Royals for four seasons before hanging up his boots after the 2011 edition. Warne captained the Rajasthan side to IPL victory during it's maiden edition in 2008. The Australian picked-up 57 wickets in 55 matches for Rajasthan at a phenomenal economy rate of 7.27. Over the years, several former players and experts have called for rule changes in order to make the game more balanced and equal for the bowlers. They have argued that if the game goes down the same track where the laws support the batsmen and big scores are emphasised, then the quality of cricket is going to come down and can also nullify the charm of Test cricket. IPL 2020 is all set to take place in the UAE between September 19 and November 10 across three venues – Dubai, Sharjah and Abu Dhabi. In the opening match, Chennai Super Kings will lock horns with Mumbai Indians in a repeat of last year’s final.  "
http://zeenews.india.com/india/oil-slick-near-mt-new-diamond-is-from-explosion-not-cargo-hold-say-sources-2308610.html,"Oil slick near MT New Diamond is from explosion, not cargo hold, say sources",09-09-2020," New Delhi: The oil slick reported as seen near MT New Diamond was from the explosions that took place in the engine room and other parts of the ship and not from the cargo hold, sources said on Wednesday (September 9, 2020) According to the captain of the MT New Diamond and the salvors who are on-site, the slick was formed by the fuel which was powering the ship(from the tank) and was not from the cargo hold. This comes amid reports of an oil leak from the vessel.  Structurally too, only the superstructure (tower) of the cargo vessel which houses the accommodation section is badly damaged owing to the blaze. The ships rear-portion(aft), as seen in the images has sunken(trim) about 3-feet into the water given the amounts of seawater and foam that was sprayed to control the blaze.  A tea of salvors have also boarded the MT New Diamond for inspection and the appropriate course of action for employing larger tugs, as a part of salvage and towing will be undertaken. It is also said that the trim at the rear portion of the ship would be corrected.  On Monday a fire had re-ignited on-board the Very Large Crude Carrier (VLCC) MT new Diamond off the Sri Lanka coast. It had been doused by Tuesday morning and boundary cooling was being done to prevent re-ignition. The fire had almost risen to a height of up to 60 meters from the main, weather-exposed deck of the ship, which is also known as the weather deck. However, the Indian Coast Guard (ICG) has said that the blaze has been visibly doused and that measures are being undertaken to prevent re-ignition.  Sustained firefighting efforts by ICG Ships Sujay, Shaurya, Sarang, specialised ICG Pollution Response Vessel Samudra Paheredar along with Srilankan Ships and tugs ensured the intensity and magnitude of fire were reduced considerably by Tuesday morning. The master of MT New Diamond, onboard ICGS Shaurya has also intimated the Coast Guard that the fire appears to have been doused. The situation is being monitored closely and boundary cooling with seawater and application of foam has been enhanced to avoid re-ignition.  The MT New Diamond is being held about 30 miles from the Sri Lankan Coast by a tug boat and joint firefighting and pollution response operations are being carried out by the assets of the Indian Coast Guard, the Indian Navy and their Sri Lankan counterparts.  The ICG vessels have been deployed for fire-fighting and consequential pollution response for MT New Diamond off since September 3rd. A bilateral MoU between ICG and SLCG covers co-operation in the Marine pollution Response domain. The Indian Coast Guard is also the Competent National Authority under South Asian Co-operative for Environment Protection (SACEP) for responding and coordinating pollution response in South Asian Sea region.  In order to supplement the surface firefighting efforts with aerial dropping, the Lankan Navy had requested the Indian Coast guard for Dry Chemical Powder (DCP). To facilitate this, ICGS Abheek with 1.5tons of DCP was diverted from on-scene to enter Trincomalee harbour for the handing over. ICG Dornier aircraft with 700 kgs DCP was also dispatched on Thursday morning from Chennai to Trincomalee.  An ICG Dornier aircraft continues to operate from Mattala, Sri Lanka besides CG Helicopter embarked on  ICGS Sarang being launched regularly for aerial assessment. No oil spill has been reported so far.  A 16-member salvage team including Marine Chemists and Naval Architects who are onboard Tugboats on-location are in agreement with the methodology adopted by ICG to fight the fire and are providing suggestions to make the firefighting more effective. This very large crude carrier- MT New Diamond is a Greek-owned vessel, under charter by Indian Oil Cooperation. The vessel has been ablaze following a major explosion in the engine room while transiting Sri Lanka’s Exclusive Economic Zone. The first information about the vessel being on fire was received at Indian Coast Guard Maritime Rescue Co-Ordination Centre (MRCC) Mumbai. MT New Diamond is reportedly carrying more than 2.7 lakh MT Kuwait export crude oil that was destined for Paradip, Odisha. According to Marinetraffic.com, MT New Diamond is a 20-year old Crude oil tanker that is 333 meters long and 60 meters wide.   "

A three-judge bench headed by Justice L N Rao referred to a larger constitution bench, to be set up by Chief Justice of India S A Bobde, the batch of pleas challenging the validity of the law granting reservation to Marathas in education and jobs. The apex court said that status of those who have already taken benefits of the 2018 law shall not be disturbed. The Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBC) Act, 2018 was enacted to grant reservation to people of the Maratha community in Maharashtra in jobs and admissions. The Bombay High Court, while upholding the law in June last year, had held that 16 percent reservation was not justifiable and said that the quota should not exceed 12 percent in employment and 13 percent in admissions. The apex court passed the order on a batch of pleas challenging the high court order and the 2018 law. On July 27, the Maharashtra government had assured the top court that it would not proceed with the recruitment process to fill up the vacancies on the basis of 12 percent Maratha reservation till September 15, except for departments, Public Health and Medical Education and Research. Advocates Amit Anand Tiwari and Vivek Singh, appearing for one of the petitioners, had earlier told the apex court that the last date for admission to PG medical courses should be deferred. The high court, in its June 27 last year order, had said that 50 percent cap on total reservations imposed by the Supreme Court could be exceeded in exceptional circumstances. It had also accepted the Maharashtra government's argument that the Maratha community was socially and educationally backward and it was duty-bound to take steps for its progress. The high court had said though the reservation was valid, its quantum -- 16 percent -- was not justifiable and it should be reduced to 12 percent and 13 percent, as recommended by the State Backward Classes Commission. One of the pleas filed in the apex court had claimed that the SEBC Act breached the 50 percent ceiling on reservation fixed by the top court in its landmark judgment in the Indira Sahwney case, also known as the 'Mandal verdict'. According to the 102nd amendment to the Constitution, reservation can be granted only if a particular community is named in the list prepared by the President. On November 30, 2018, the Maharashtra legislature had passed a bill granting 16-per cent reservation to Marathas. The report submitted by the State Backward Classes Commission was based on quantifiable and contemporaneous data and was correct in classifying the Maratha community as socially and educationally backward, the high court had said in its verdict.   "

Union Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and his French counterpart Florence will be the chief guests for the event.  The first batch of five Rafale jets, which arrived at the Ambala airbase on July 29, have already proven their mettle with successful weapons firing at a test range after arrival. When the first batch of Rafales arrived at Ambala, the IAF had said that efforts are focused on operationalisation of the aircraft at the earliest. An official statement of the IAF read, ""At Ambala, the event will include the ceremonial unveiling of the Rafale aircraft, a traditional ‘Sarva Dharma Puja’, Air Display by Rafale and Tejas aircraft as well as by ‘Sarang Aerobatic Team’. Afterwards, a traditional water cannon salute will be given to the Rafale aircraft. The programme will culminate with the ceremonial induction of Rafale aircraft to 17 Squadron."" After the ceremonial events, the Indian and French delegation will have a bilateral meeting, read the statement. Other than having a bilateral meeting with Rajnath Singh, Parly will also meet National Security Advisor (NSA) Ajit Doval, sources had said earlier. After the ceremony, the French side is also likely to raise the possibility of a larger order for the Rafale fighter jets under the 'Make in India' initiative, sources had said.   The statement also said that Chief of Defence Staff General Bipin Rawat, Chief of the Air Staff Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria, Defence Secretary Dr Ajay Kumar, Secretary Department of Defence R&D and Chairman DRDO Dr G Satheesh Reddy along with other senior officers of Ministry of Defence and Armed Forces will be present to mark a very important milestone in the history of the IAF. The French delegation will be represented by Ambassador of France to India Emmanuel Lenain, Air General Eric Autellet, Vice Chief of the Air Staff of the French Air Force and other senior officials. A large delegation of senior functionaries of French Defence Industries which includes Eric Trappier Chairman and Chief Executive of Dassault Aviation and Eric Beranger, CEO, MBDA will be present during the ceremony. The first batch of five incoming Rafale fighter jets landed at the Ambala Air Force base around 3.14 PM on July 29, 2020, amid a ceremonial welcome and unprecedented security. The squadron of Rafale jets has been stationed at the Ambala airbase in Haryana. The fleet of five jets comprises three single-seater and two twin-seater aircraft. The jets will be inducted into the IAF as part of its No. 17 Squadron, also known as the 'Golden Arrows'. Nearly four years ago, India had signed an inter-governmental agreement with France to purchase 36 Rafale jets under a Rs 59,000-crore deal to boost the IAF's combat capabilities.  The aircraft is capable of carrying a range of potent weapons. European missile maker MBDA's Meteor beyond visual range air-to-air missile and Scalp cruise missile will be the mainstay of the weapons package of the Rafale jets. Of the 36 jets, 30 will be fighter jets and six will be trainers. The trainer jets will be twin-seater and they will have almost all the features of the fighter jets. The IAF has undertaken major infrastructure upgrades at the Ambala base for the deployment of the first Rafale squadron. Built in 1948, the airbase is located on the east side of Ambala and is used for military and government flights. The airbase has two squadrons of the Jaguar combat aircraft and one squadron of the MIG-21 'Bison'. Air Force Marshal Arjan Singh was the first commander of the base. The Mirage fighters that were used for the airstrike in Balakot in Pakistan in February 2019 after the Pulwama terror attack had taken off from Ambala. The Rafale aircraft will give India a strategic advantage in case of any aerial combat with China in the mountainous Tibet region as the fleet will be able to use the terrain to its advantage, destroy enemy air defence and incapacitate the surface-to-air missiles, former Chief of Air Staff Air Chief Marshal (retd) BS Dhanoa had said to news agency PTI in August. Dhanoa, known as the architect of the Balakot strikes, had said the Rafale jets along with S-400 missile systems will give the Indian Air Force a major combat edge in the entire region and that India's adversaries will think twice before starting a war with it. In case of Pakistan, he had said the purpose of the S-400 and Rafale is to hit Pakistani aircraft inside Pakistani air space and not when they come inside Indian territory, adding the neighbouring country would not have responded on February 27, 2019, to the Balakot air strikes if India had the French-manufactured jets then. In an interview to PTI, Dhanoa had said the Rafale, with its fantastic electronic warfare suite and manoeuvrability, will be able to use mountainous terrain in Tibet to its advantage and blind the enemy before India's strike aircraft penetrate hostile airspace to carry out their missions.

http://zeenews.india.com/people/undue-attention-being-given-to-kangana-ranaut-says-ncp-chief-sharad-pawar-raises-doubts-over-bmc-action-2308590.html,"Undue attention being given to Kangana Ranaut, says NCP chief Sharad Pawar, raises doubts over BMC action",09-09-2020," MUMBAI: Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar said on Wednesday (September 9, 2020) that undue importance is being attached to the statements made by Bollywood actress Kangana Ranaut. ""We are giving undue importance to those making such statements. We will have to see what influence such statements have on the people at large,"" the NCP chief told reporters. ""In my opinion, people do not take seriously (such statements),"" the veteran NCP leader said. The veteran Maharashtra politician said that people are not taking her remarks seriously. The former Union minister, however, raised doubt over the Shiv Sena-controlled Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) move to demolish “illegally constructed” portions of the Bandra bungalow of Bollywood actress Kangana Ranaut. Pawar said that he is not fully aware of the BMC action against the actress. “Illegal construction in Mumbai is nothing new. BMC has its own set rules to deal with cases of illegal construction in Mumbai,’’ he said.    Pawar said the people of Maharashtra and Mumbai have ""years of experience"" of how the state and city's police work. ""They (people) know the performance of the police. And hence, we need not pay heed to what one says,"" he added. Ranaut waded into controversy after she recently likened Mumbai to Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) and said she feared the city Police more than the ""movie mafia"". Ranaut landed in Mumbai from her home state Himachal Pradesh on Wednesday, amid protests by Shiv Sena workers at the airport over her remarks on Mumbai police. Kangana, who flew from Chandigarh by a scheduled commercial flight, landed at Mumbai around 2.30 PM. Sena workers with black flags were seen outside the airport, shouting slogans against her. Workers of the RPI (A) and Karni Sena had also gathered in support of the actor. RPI (A) leader and Union minister Ramdas Athawale had declared that his party workers will protect Kangana while she is in Mumbai. Kangana has courted a controversy with her recent comments about the Mumbai Police and Maharashtra. In response to a remark by Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut where he asked her not to come back to the city after she claimed she felt unsafe in the city, Kangana had compared Mumbai with PoK.   "
